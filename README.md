# UC Uninstaller (discontinued)
## What it is?
An old project of mine, abandoned due to lack of time and not using Windows anymore... Written in C# as my little pet project in high school. Also uses SQLite database.

## What does it do?
Mostly PC cleaning... The app searches registry, detect potencionally unwanted apps and provides the means to (silently) uninstall them. There was an server backend that was used to create new database and such, but no longer working... 

## Why was it created?
There were various reasons, but it burns down to these:
* Didn't want to always uninstall shitty apps
* Wanted to make my programming skills better
* Curiosity
* áº„anted to fvck up my Windows

## Licensing
This work was licensed under GNU GPL v3 licence, but nowadays I don't really care what happens to it... Feel free to fork it, pick up the development or whatever... 

#### Footnote:
I developed this sheit when I was like 16, so the code is probably a mess... Good luck to anyone who tries to read it :P
